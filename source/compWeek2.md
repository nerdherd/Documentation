Vision pickup was also tested and tuned to work.  Talon tachs and hall effect sensors were tested in order to be mounted on the robot to limit movement.

### Vision Group

We tuned PID for vision following​, more specifically, the sequence for scoring gameobjects on the grid.
For auto and teleop​, updated the calibration procedure​ for limelight dashboard and added specific images of contours.

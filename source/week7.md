This week, the swerve drive group adjusted the auto code to accommodate for the alliance.  Motion magic was tuned for the arm and elevator, allowing for consistent game piece pickup and scoring. Soft limits were also added to protect the elevator and arm from breaking. The vision group switched both limelights to have limelight firmware and added code for object detection and approach.

# Competition Week 5
*Week 12 (3/26 - 4/1)*

## Programming

We went to DaVinci Schools. Upon arriving, we tested both our preload pickup score pickup auto and preload taxi charge auto.

The mentor of 4201 The Vitruvian Bots was gracious enough to provide us with some cheese pizza! We greatly appreciated the kind gesture, and were able to test a lot of different parts of our autos.

Vision programming process:
- We used a wait command of 1000 seconds to isolate different sections of our auto
- We also enabled single trajectories at a time
- Our ventures were quite successful that day, we got like around 8 full videos of the working auto to put on teams and impress Mr. Harder and the rest of the NerdHerd

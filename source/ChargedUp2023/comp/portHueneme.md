# Hueneme Port Regional

From March 2 to March 5, we competed in the Hueneme Port Regional, in Ventura, CA.

During the qualifications rounds, we ranked 15th, with a record of 7-3-0.

We were invited to join the 4th alliance by alliance captain team 972, Iron Claw, 
and were joined by team 2429, La Ca√±ada Engineering Club.

Although we were eliminated in Match 9 of the playoffs, due to failures in our 
charging auto and a failed balancing in endgame, this event taught us a lot
about what we needed to improve on. For example, we learned that picking up cones
from the ground was incredbly slow with our current design, and that we needed to work
on improving our autos' reliability.

Congratulations to team 4414, High Tide, team 1678, Citrus Circuits, and team 696, Circuit Breakers, for winning the event! Their final against team 6036, Peninsula Robotics, team 4481,
team Rembrandts, and team 3859, Wolfpack Robotics, was extremely close, with a tie in the first
round, and even a field reset in one match.

# Aerospace Valley Regional

From March 29th to April 1st, we competed in the Aerospace Valley Regional in Lancaster, CA.

During qualifications, we ranked 9th, with a record of 8-4-0.

We were picked to be on the 5th alliance by team 4698, Raider Robotics, choosing team 399, 
Eagle Robotics, to be our third alliance member.

Although we were eliminated in Playoffs match 10, we learned valuable lessons from this 
event that helped us at worlds. For example, we learned the importance of gaining mobility
points during autonmous, as these were vital in winning many matches.

Congratulations to team 7157, Î¼Botics, 4414, High Tide, and 7042, Poly Rabbotics, for winning the event! Poly Rabbotics is from Long Beach Polytechnic High School, which shares the same school
district as us, so we were excited to see that they also qualified for the World Championship.

### Sponsorship

Administration works on sponsorship documentation to provide funding for our team. While we have the help of our parents, funding for the team will continue. We made sponsorship letters to send to other companies. Honda is one of our new sponsors! Raising Canes, Raytheon, HAAS, Parker, and Boeing continue to be among our strong supporters

### Apparel

New apparel has been released for the new year! Family, friends, and fans of Nerd Herd are able to buy apparel to represent the spirit of our team!

### Grants

We received a sponsorship grant from REV Robotics. We are also working to create our application for a grant from HAAS.

### Parent Presentations


We held a parent meeting to help both FRC and FTC parents register themselves and their children for FIRST. We also provided ways for the parents to connect to each other and to receieve sign up links they are encouraged to volunteer for.

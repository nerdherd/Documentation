### Chezy Champs

Chezy Champs is being hosted in San Jose by Cheesy Poofs 254 in Bellarmine Preparatory. It will be hosted on 9/30 and 10/1 and Nerd Herd will be participating with approximately 40 members and mentors. We have prepared by buying supplies for the presentation of the Nerd Herd team. This includes making pins, documents, and spirit materials that share the areas of our teams.

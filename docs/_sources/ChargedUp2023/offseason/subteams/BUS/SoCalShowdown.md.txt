### Introduction

Nerd Herd 687 is hosting an offseason competition with Phantom Catz 2637 and Vitruvian Bots 4201. October 7 and October 8 will be the offseason competition that is planned for more than 35 teams. The Administration team has been collaborating with the other teams to manage and organize this competition. 

### Administration

The Administration team coordinated to have food and volunteers to run the event efficiently. These will include food orders and snack "stores" that will provide for participating teams. We will have Chipotle and Raising Canes, but we also have boba for those who request. 

### Volunteering

While our team will have robots partcipating in this offseason competition, our members will be volunteering to assist for the event. The students will help with the practice field, queuing, supervising, and snacks. Volunteering will have engagement from the members.

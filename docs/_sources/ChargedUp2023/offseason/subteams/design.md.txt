#### Drive Base:

We chose a swerve drive base because it is essential for a cube spammer to be able to quickly maneuver around the arena. A swerve drive base would enable our drivers to quickly pick up cubes anywhere on the arena. Compared to a west coast drive base, which is slow and hard to maneuver, it was clear that a swerve drive base would be a better option.

#### Intake:

We wanted an intake that could
1.	Easily pick up cubes
2.	Quickly drop cubes into the bottom row
3.	Shoot cubes into the mid and high rows

#### Hard Stop:

We designed our hard stop to hold the intake in a stowed position. The hard stop made programming the pivot a lot easier.

## Rotation Linear (RL)

### Pivot:

Pivot Idea for RL Bot:
1.	Design a pivot that can rotate and be able to rotate to reach all 3 rows, the top, middle, and bottom rows. 
2.	Pivot can rotate to reach both substations and ground to be able to pick up game pieces.
3.	Offset pivot for more extension
4.	Able to have elevator resting down
5.	Able to fit in robot and fit both the elevator and electrical.
Inspiration we used for our pivot included robots:
•	Team 1678 (Citrus Circuit)

(When using 1678’s pivot as reference, avoid bent plate as we are unable to make that) 
First Iteration:
For the first iteration of the pivot, we based our design on 1678 just without the bent base plate as said. Dimensions that we used were 15 inches for the vertical bar and 15 inches for the horizontal bar, the horizontal bar was raised 2.5 inches. The bars were this long so that it is long enough to clear the swerve modules and it was raised to be over the swerve modules without hitting it.

Second Iteration:
For our second iteration of the pivot, we shortened the horizontal bars by 3 inches as it gives more space for electrical instead of having 15 inches, now it is 12 inches. Due to the change in length, the motors more to the front instead of the back so that the swerves had enough space. The vertical bars are raised higher to allow more room for the elevator to rotate up and it creates the ability to attach the elevator to the pivot without hitting anything above or below. There’s also a new horizontal bar at the top which is a stoppage point so the elevator doesn’t over rotate. There is an extra plate there to add stiffness.  With the new horizontal bar, it serves as a mounting point for the limelight.

Target tracking with systems like Limelight enhances a robotics team's performance, consistency, and strategic capabilities in competitions while providing valuable learning opportunities for team members. It's a crucial tool for success in the world of competitive robotics. Tracking a target using a system like Limelight can be incredibly beneficial for a robotics team in various ways:

### 1. Precise Autonomous Navigation:

During autonomous periods of a robotics competition, accurately tracking a target allows the robot to navigate the field with precision. This is especially important for tasks like scoring game pieces or reaching specific locations.

### 2. Efficient Scoring:

In games where robots need to interact with targets or goals, tracking helps in aligning the robot for accurate and efficient scoring. It reduces the margin of error, making it more likely for the team to earn points.

### 3. Improved Teleoperated Control:

During teleoperated (driver-controlled) periods, target tracking assists drivers in maintaining alignment with game elements, reducing the effort required to control the robot effectively.

### 4. Consistency:

Target tracking systems provide consistency in robot performance. Regardless of the driver's skill level, the robot can consistently perform tasks that involve aligning with targets.

### 5. Strategic Advantage:

Teams that can reliably track and interact with targets gain a strategic advantage in competitions. They can execute game strategies with a higher degree of success.

### 6. Learning and Skill Development:

Using a system like Limelight allows team members to gain experience in computer vision, which is a valuable skill in STEM fields. It can inspire students to pursue careers in engineering, robotics, or computer science.

### 7. Data Collection:

Target tracking systems can also collect valuable data during matches, such as the accuracy of shots or the efficiency of certain maneuvers. This data can be used for post-match analysis and strategy refinement.

### 8. Scalability:

Once implemented, a target tracking system can often be adapted for use in different games or scenarios with minimal adjustments, saving time and effort in future seasons.

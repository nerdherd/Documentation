# World Championship 

## Archimedes Division (4/19 - 4/21)

At the World Championship, we were placed in the Archimedes Division, which was filled
with powerhouse teams such as 254, the Cheesy Poofs, 2056, OP Robotics, 6036, 
Peninsula Robotics, and many more.

During Qualification matches, we placed 10th, with a match record of 8-2-0.

However, we were one of the last teams to be picked, being chosen as the 4th alliance 
member of alliance 6, which consisted of 8085, team MOJO, 6328, Mechanical Advantage,
and team 972, Iron Claw, who had previously been our alliance captain at
the Hueneme Port Regional.

During this event, many field failures and upsets occurred.
For example, Alliance 1, which consisted of 254, 2056, 27, and 4903, 
was defeated in round 2 of the playoffs, due to 2056 shutting down. 
Additionally, during our Semifinals match against Alliance 2, 6036 shut down.

During Playoffs, due to mechanical issues with 8085's intake, we were subbed in for
the Semifinals matches (Match 12 and 13), allowing our team to advance to the Finals.

Although we were subbed back out for team 8085 during Finals 1, we lost the first
match 192-155, against Alliance 3, 2607, 4028, and 33. However, we were subbed back in
for Finals 2, which we were able to win. During Finals 3, our alliance partners,
8085, 6328, and 972 were able to win by 179 to 150, causing our alliance to win
the Archimedes Division, letting us advance to the Einstein field.

## Einstein (4/22)

On the Einstein field, we were subbed back in for team 8085 for Match 1, against Newton division's winning alliance, losing by only two points (187-189).

8085 then returned for Match 5, against Galileo's winning alliance. Although we were eliminated,
losing by ten points (166-176), we were glad to be able to compete on Einstein field.

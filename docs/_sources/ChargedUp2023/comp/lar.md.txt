# Los Angeles Regional

From March 16 to March 19, we participated in the Los Angeles Regional at Da Vinci Schools.

During qualifications, we went undefeated, becoming the first-seed alliance. 
We allianced with team 5199, The Robot Dolphins from Outer Space, and 
team 702, Bagel Bytes, for our first playoffs match.
Due to mechanical issues, Bagel Bytes was subbed out by team 6833, Phoenix Robotics,
for the remainder of playoffs.

Throughout playoffs, we went undefeated until finals, where we narrowly won 2-1 
against alliance 2, which consisted of:
4123, Tribe Robotics, 294, Beach Cities Robotics, and 1452, Omnicats. 

This regional win qualified us, 5199, and 702 for the Houston World Championships.
Additionally, we won the Industrial Design Award sponsored by General Motors,
and our technician, Brianna Adewinmbi, won the Dean's List Finalist Award.

We would like to thank our alliance parners, team 5199, team 702, and team 6833, for
competing with us in this tournament, as well as team 4201, The Vitruian Bots, 
for hosting the event and allowing us to use their practice field.

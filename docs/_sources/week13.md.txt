We went to DaVinci Schools. Upon arriving, we tested both our preload pickup score pickup auto and preload taxi charge auto.
The mentor of 4201 The Vitruvian Bots was gracious enough to provide us with some cold, hard cheese pizza. Needless to say, it was pretty bad but we appreciated the kind gesture.

Vision programming process:
- We used a wait command of 1000 seconds to isolate different sections of our auto
- We also enabled single trajectories at a time
- Our ventures were quite successful that day, we got like around 8 full videos of the working auto to put on teams and impress Mr. Harder and the rest of the NerdHerd

Signing off,
